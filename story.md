## All academic publications

You can find them [here in the institutional repository ](https://iris.imtlucca.it/browse?type=author\&authority=rp01154\&sort_by=2\&order=DESC#.YLNsQZMza3I)of IMT Lucca.

## Other stuff

Fast forward to the 2000s, and you'll find that less people are willing to dedicate their time to help young professionals grow, and fewer novices know to reach out and ask.

> Everything of value that I learned in my career, came from other people's stories and experience.”

This is why I decided to create a practical guide that would serve as an internship for those who want to excel in marketing. Instead of looking for a mentor, students and young marketers can read all the wealth of knowledge I acquired throught the years and digest it at their pace.

## Hands On Practice

There's nothing like trying things out for yourself.

In my book, you will find countless guides, tutorials, walk throughs, worksheets and collateral starters, to help you roll up your sleeves and apply your learnings. We even offer 1hr consultations by seasoned professionals, monthly webinars, and live Q\&A sessions to help you hone in on the topics that are most relevant to your work.![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuTfG2WLSxU\&feature=emb_title)
